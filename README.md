<h1 align="center">🌐 OmeJS – OmeTV IP Tracker in Console</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>Enhance your OmeTV experience with real-time IP geolocation – right from your browser console.</em>
</p>

## 📖 About

**OmeJS** is a browser-based script that hooks into `WebRTC` used by [Ome.tv](https://ome.tv) and extracts public IP addresses (`srflx`) of strangers you connect with.

It then fetches geolocation data using `ipgeolocation.io` and displays it in a floating, draggable UI box — without modifying the page's source code.

> No browser extension, no app install. Just paste the code into your Developer Tools console.
